# Gladius
This project trys to make it easier to edit the game files in the game Gladius by LucasArts. I'm mainly working on the GameCube version, but the tools for the game-files also work with the PS2 and XBox version.

Everything was tested with the US GameCube version of Gladius.
The md5sum of the ISO is a78d6e1c9de69886ce827ad2a7507339.
